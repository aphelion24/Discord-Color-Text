What can I do if colored text is not working?
If youâ€™re having trouble with our color codes, try the pasting the text from the generator on the app instead of the website. And remember that some of these color codes work better than others. You might also be using a mobile app, which doesn't allow coloring always.
You should also check that you use backticks, not quotation marks. You can find backticks from the left-hand corner of your keyboard with the tilde option above it. Use that key instead of using any quotation marks.
If nothing else works, try the following:
```fix
text is here```
This usually fixes the most problems with the text coloring. Sometimes with the Desktop app or web browser, you need to type the markdown codes yourself.
